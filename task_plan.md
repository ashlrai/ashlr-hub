## Key Questions
1. What prevents Ashlr Hub from acting as a reliable always-on engineering fleet today?
2. Which surrounding Ashlr repos are key infrastructure versus abandoned experiments?
3. What should be built into Mission Control so the system feels operationally useful every day?
4. What risks would make 24/7 autonomy dangerous, expensive, noisy, or untrustworthy?
5. What can be improved immediately in this repo without destabilizing the pushed baseline?

## Decisions Made
- Use multiple agents because the user explicitly asked for broad parallel exploration and maximum ambition.
- Keep current hub `master` clean and synced as baseline; new work should be incremental and verified before pushing.
- Audit the ecosystem from local repos first, then use GitHub/official docs only where current external state matters.
- Bound the CI/publish test gate with a hermetic wrapper instead of letting leaked handles freeze autonomous delivery indefinitely.
- Land small operational patches now: service restart delay and inbox review fields.
- Land daemon singleton hardening now: exclusive lock, heartbeat, stale dead-owner takeover, token-checked release, and state temp-file collision reduction.
- Clear Vite/esbuild advisories with a conservative Vitest 3 + Vite 6 override migration instead of jumping straight to Vitest 4 / Vite 8.
- Next local critical path is shared queue health in Mission Control because a multi-machine autonomous fleet needs visible lease, reclaim, and owner distribution signals.
- Current autonomy critical path is making auto-merge evidence explicit and durable so higher-quality agents can merge by default without forcing Mason to reconstruct safety from logs.
- Evidence visibility should ride on `FleetStatus` so API, CLI, Mission Control, and Fleet Dashboard all share one read-only autonomy signal.

## Errors Encountered
- Entire is not set up for this repo; `entire resume master` has no checkpoint.
- Full serial Vitest can hang after many tests with one worker alive; mitigated with `scripts/test-ci.mjs` watchdog for CI/publish gates.

## Agent Findings From Follow-Up Audit
- Shared queue leases are not renewed during long runs; dry-run shared claims should release immediately.
- Concurrent dispatch plans currently do not force the assigned backend all the way through execution.
- `resource-pause:` decisions need daemon-level skip handling beside `throttled:` and `budget-pause:`.
- Codex/GPT-5 judge attestation should use one shared frontier-judge predicate in auto-merge and inline merge paths.
- Mission Control's auto-merge feed should include `inbox:auto-merge` audit events, not only `merge.*` actions.
- Current pass landed shared queue lease renewal, dry-run claim release, concurrent-dispatch backend assignment enforcement, `resource-pause:` skip handling, and CI isolation hardening for leaked `ASHLR_HOME`/date/auth assumptions.
- Current usefulness batch landed Mission Control/Fleet/Fleet Dashboard pause-resume controls, token-gated pause/resume APIs, a conservative Vitest 3/Vite 6 security migration, and a plugin-registry import fallback for Vitest 3's module runner.
- Current pass agents identified next lanes: spend persistence fail-closed dispatch guards, queue lease/reclaim metrics, backend assignment traces, and an `ashlr ecosystem doctor` inventory command.
- Current pass landed strict daemon state reads, result-returning daemon state saves, a durable spend-commit guard, and daemon/run-loop fail-closed behavior for malformed/unwritable spend state.
- Current pass agents refined next lanes: additive `FleetStatus.queue.shared` health, persisted daemon backend assignment traces, and a read-only `ashlr ecosystem doctor --json --root --deep`.
- Current queue-health pass adds read-only shared queue lease/cooldown/lock health to `FleetStatus`, CLI status/watch, Mission Control, Fleet, and Fleet Dashboard snapshots.
- Repair UX audit found that `daemon status`, doctor, and web surfaces still mask malformed daemon/spend-guard state through forgiving loaders; next pass should expose a shared additive guard-health block before attempting auto-repair.
- Backend trace audit found gateway decisions already have traces but daemon ticks persist only aggregate backend counts; next pass should persist bounded `backendAssignments` beside existing tick counts.
- Ecosystem doctor audit recommends a read-only `ashlr ecosystem doctor [--json] [--root] [--deep]` command with tool inventory and sibling repo health.
- Current autonomy pass adds `~/.ashlr/evidence/<proposalId>.json` evidence packs, a pure `AutonomyPolicyVerdict` ladder, and a pre-mutation Gate 8 in `autoMergeProposal` that fails closed if the evidence pack cannot be persisted or the policy denies the requested action.
- Current visibility pass adds evidence pack read/list helpers, surfaces autonomy evidence in `FleetStatus`, CLI status/watch, `/api/fleet`, `/api/control`, `/api/snapshot`, Mission Control, Fleet, Fleet Dashboard, and read-only `/api/autonomy/evidence` endpoints.
- Current trust fix makes the newest judged decision authoritative in the verification gate, so a newer non-ship verdict overrides any older signed `ship`.

## Status
**Current evidence visibility pass verified** - Evidence visibility and newest-judge ordering are implemented; focused tests, typecheck, lint, build, and diff check pass. Preparing commit and push.
